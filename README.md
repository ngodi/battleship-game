Battleship
==========

![battleship](battleship.png)

Battleship is a game played on the browser between a user and the computer. The game starts with both users manually placing their ships on their respective Gameboards(a grid of squares). The ships are shot by the opponent in-turn with the objective to hit the full length of a ship and all the other ships. A missed shot is marked by a circle(O) on the gameboard and a hit is marked by a cross(X) on the gameboard and on the hit ship as well. The game ends when all the ships on a given gameboard have all been hit; they are said to be sunk, the opponent is then declared winner.
